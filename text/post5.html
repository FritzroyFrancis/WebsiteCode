Hello, there. It's been a while... so long, in fact, that I have no real idea who you are.<br /><br />

I've done a terrible job keeping up with most of my friends in the year since college ended, so I figure Imight as well give a rundown on what has happened to me since.<br /><br />

I still don't subscribe to the whole "welcome to the real world" thinking, but I definitely wasn't prepared for the path I took when I graduated. I didn't know the stuff I needed to know, and I didn't have the experiences that I should have. I wish that the university did a better job of putting proper emphasis on the things I should know when looking for a job, instead of every professor telling me the most important thing is the thing they are teaching, but I hate to throw blame, as it in itself never results in progress. I spent the entire first summer looking for jobs I wasn't prepared for, and ended up losing out on them all.<br /><br />

At a certain point, I took a break from looking and started working at retail... and it took my passion, energy and will away. I noticed after the holiday season that there was no way I could keep going on like this. In February, I started taking my life back. Web development was what I started getting into, and I created crappy design after crappy design before I could start performing at the pace I wanted. I worked on a couple websites, particulary during April and May, and finished this personal site in July, a month after I quit retail. I know that summer is not the best time for doing interviews (I hate dressing up in a suit during hot weather just as much as you hate being in an office during hot weather), so the hunt still hasn't gone back up in pace to where it was a year ago, but I still have much more faith in myself and confidence in my ability to perform, rather than hopelessly wishing someone grab me out of pure chance. Don't get me wrong, I'm still not done with my work. I love being a creative (because it's cool to use "creative" as a noun). I've always been one, especially when it comes to music (as the section above may imply) and there are so many ideas I still have left in me waiting to be pulled out. Let's just pray that someday, all this play can eventually become pay.
