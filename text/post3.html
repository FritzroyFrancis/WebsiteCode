The one piece of equipment that has always been definitive of video games (besides a screen, perhaps) is starting to manifest in different ways before our own eyes... so here I am talking about it. I decided to explore this topic of video game controllers by separating it into 4 main subjects; traditional controllers, joysticks, motion-based controllers, and... humans as controllers? Controller-less controllers? You know, the Kinect and stuff.<br /><br />

<span style="text-align:center"><b><i>The Kinect and Stuff</i></b><br /><br /></span>

Microsoft made a big move in the gaming industry in the fall of 2010 when they released the Kinect, Microsoft's response to the popular Wiimote. However the Kinect took motion gaming a step further and removed any physical counterpart to the gaming experience. As they marketed, you were the controller. To call it a big success would be an understatement. To be more accurate, the Kinect holds the Guinness World Record as the "fastest selling consumer electronics device," which is astounding considering it doesn't have the functional flexibility of an iPhone or iPad, and actually requires an Xbox to use.<br /><br />

<b>Advantages</b><br /><br />

<b>No controller to break.</b>: Oh the numerous tales I have of needing a new controller to buy because <i>all hardware hates me</i>. It's a good feeling to know that the Kinect avoids that problem.<br /><br />

<b>Easily understood controls</b>: If you're playing Kinect Joy Ride - a racing game that no person with experience in motion or physics should actually play - for the first time and you don't know how the game works, you're intuition will tell you to hold your arms as if you were holding a steering wheel, and that's because it's the smart thing to do. Now, let's say you're playing Twisted Metal for the first time on a traditional Playstation controller, and you want to figure out what the button is for acceleration. You will <i>never</i> get it right just off of instinct alone. I don't even know what the developers were thinking when they mapped the controls onto the controller. It's the Square button... you explain to me why that makes sense.<br /><br />

<b>Disadvantages</b><br /><br />

<b>You can't use it while sitting down... or relaxing at all</b>: A lot of times... in fact, most of the time I play a game, I use it as a way to just lay back, zone everything else out, and play. However, that is hard to do when the games that require the Kinect can't be played sitting down (no matter how many times Microsoft denies it).<br /><br />

<b>Lag:</b> Computers are pretty quick when it comes to responding to input. You send the command (say, the x button), the processor reads that commands and interprets it to do a specific action based on the scenario in the game (say, shoot at zombies in slow motion while Burt Reynolds runs over them in his Trans Am). With the Kinect, the time it takes is much longer because it has to know when the command (i.e. body movement) starts and ends, and that interpretation is not so easy to implement. The result is that the time between you doing a command and the game performing that act is significantly (and noticeably) longer, and that can ruin gameplay because you always have to think .2 seconds sooner than you normally would.<br /><br />

<span style="text-align:center"><b><i>Motion Based Controllers (Wii, Move)</i></b><br /><br /></span>

To be clear, the Wii certainly isn't the alpha of motion gaming. However, it is almost certainly the most important in the history of video games, simply because of it's widespread popularity. Their competitors first called it a mere gimmick, and those same competitors were copying in a couple years.<br /><br />

<b>Advantages</b><br /><br />

<b>Most of the advantages of #1 without most of the drawbacks</b>: It's a good medium between using a camera as your only interface and having an overly complicated controller. You don't need to look up how to punch in Wii Boxing, but you dont need to look confused like when you realized that there is no command for braking in <i>Kinect Joy Ride</i>.<br /><br />

<b>Disadvantages</b><br /><br />

<b>Inaccuracy:</b> The Wii early on had a bad reputation for not doing what it was supposed to do very accurately. No matter how you attack that problem, the idea that a camera is going to be used to properly read where you are moving will inevitably lead to the computer reading something wrong.<br /><br />

<span style="text-align:center"><b><i>Fighting Joysticks</i></b></span><br /><br />

<b>Advantages</b><br /><br />
<b>Excellent for games that require fast input (i.e. fighting games):</b> 
On a joystick, nothing is hiding away from your reach. All the inputs are incredibly simple to understand, which is why they are so great for games that need you to make commands quickly<br /><br />

<b>Disadvantages</b><br /><br />

<b>A bit extinct, to say the least:</b> The joystick doesn't get the love that other gaming controllers have. No one I know owns a joystick, and if they do, it's because they are a long-time fighting game fan. Even though it is the most efficient controller, it is the least popular and is usually bought strictly by for that specific niche.<br />
<br />

<span style="text-align:center"><b><i>Gamepads (Dualshock, Xbox)</i></b></span><br /><br />

<b>Advantages</b><br /><br />

<b>A berserk number of things to do:</b> The number of individual commands you can do on a controller is over 20, and that's assuming you're only pressing one buttons at a time. Using Up and X together brings up a much larger number. Add the Dualshock SixAxis functionality (granted, no one uses it), and I think you get the point. It's small but with - practically speaking - limitless potential.<br /><br />

<b>Disadvatanges:</b><br /><br />

<b>Noticeably inefficient for quick input:</b> Look an a typical video gamepad. Imagine yourself holding on to that controller, waiting for the console to start the game, but you don't know what games you're going to play. Through years of gaming experience, you've already figured out you will use your right thumb for the face buttons (A, B, X, Y) and the right analog stick, along with the start, select, and menu buttons. Don't forget that the left thumb will be for the left analog stick and the d-pad. You've probably decided to use your index finger for at least one (perhaps both) of the shoulder bumpers on each side (RB, LB, RT, LT). That is quite a lot for four fingers to do. On the other hand, you have your ring finger (and perhaps your middle finger as well) sitting on the bottom of the controller doing <i>absolutely nothing</i>. This is, to say the least, an inefficient utilization of resources. You have 2 fingers doing 19 of the 23 commands your controller can do, and you have 6 fingers doing nothing.<br /><br />

What's the problem with this? Well, imagine fighting games. I can't be the only person who holds my controller different when playing fighting games than when I play any other game. I usually just forget how I usually do it and hold my right hand completely above the face buttons because my thumb alone cant perform moves fast enough. However, that also provides a problem because the buttons are so close together that I can miss the buttons quite a lot. It's easy to conclude that fighting games are unfit for traditional controllers. However, I think its' the other way around. Traditional gamepads are inefficient at many things. For shooters (Call of Duty, Uncharted, etc) the analog stick is used to make an approximation of how fast the reticle should move in a specific direction for you to set up your aim. With a keyboard and mouse, you move the mouse in a direction and  the reticle goes there. Someone needs to redesign the traditional controller setup to make way for faster and more precise command input. Hopefully <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-steam-controller-design-adds-analog-stick-repo/1100-6421328/">Valve's idea</a> comes to fruition.
