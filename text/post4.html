<span style="text-align: left;">I decided to give you a quick review of a game I've been playing for a while not. </span><i style="text-align: left;">Saints&nbsp;Row: The Third</i><span style="text-align: left;"> is a 2011 release from THQ. If you aren't familiar with the series, let me just say that it is along the lines of a more ridiculous </span><i style="text-align: left;">Grand Theft Auto</i><span style="text-align: left;">. To keep this game short, I'll just highlight the good and bad of the game.</span></div>
<br />
<br />
<b>Good - Humor</b>: This game is loaded with humor, and you are&nbsp;guaranteed&nbsp;fun entertainment from the Autotuned Pimp to the ending which is a parody of Uncharted 2. The game missions are not very tactical, as every cutscene before a mission goes as follows:<br />
<br />
Person 1: So we have to infiltrate the opposing gang's headquarters, but there is security everywhere. How will we do this?<br />
Person 2: Bust in there and f*ck sh*t up?<br />
Person 1: Sounds good to me<br />
<br />
A simple strategy like that leads way to nice mindless fun, and that is what this game is all about. On top of all that, this game is just insane. You can attack people with Aitrstrikes, an RPG, and Cyber Shotguns (or just use a Cyber Tank. Your choice). You can drive around in jet-propelled motorbikes. This game is as awesome as you could ever want it to be.<br />
<br />
<b>Good - Soundtrack</b>: Oh all the new artists I have become a fan of just from playing this game. The music selection isn't as diverse as the series' predecessor, but it certainly has a lot of good feel to it. <br />
<br />
<b>Bad - Graphics &amp; Performance: </b>Its not that the art design of the game itself is bad, it's that the game runs poorly. Objects seem to appear out of the blue like trees and, well, planes. Planes popping up out of nowhere have a tendency to scare the crap out of me.<br />
Also, the game is very very glitchy. The amount of times that my head has gotten stuck through a wall or got run over to the point that I was literally under the ground is actually countless, and I won't even get into the frame rate issues. I think that this game may have had the oh so normal problem of being developed for the Xbox 360, and ported over to the PS3 loosely so it wouldn't run as well. I don't see why developers still would do that in 2011. The game's software engine doesn't seem built well enough to handle all the explosions and carnage you can do in the game.<br />
<br />
<b>Bad - Let's Be Honest; It's Not Very Female-Friendly: </b>The concept of prostitution is pretty prevalent in the game. Many of the side missions involve saving them and murdering them. The scene in some of the owned properties in the game involve seeing girls on a stripper pole dancing for <i>absolutely no one</i>, and people getting lapdances for approximately <i>forever</i>. Yes, there are some admirable female roles in the game (and by "some," I mean "2") but it doesn't make up for the uncomfort.<br />
<br />
And I'm ambivalent about the whole "I'm using a 4-foot purple sex toy to slap people with" thing... <a href="http://thegamingliberty.com/wp-content/uploads/saintsrow_purplefriend.jpg">and I'm not going to post a picture of it.</a><br />
<br />
<b>Verdict: </b>Despite of its flaws, Saints Row: The Third is still an extremely fun time when you want to have absolutely mindless fun and blow up gangs with RPG's. If I have to give a grade on it, though it's not something I like to do often, an 8/10 seems fitting.&nbsp;</div>
