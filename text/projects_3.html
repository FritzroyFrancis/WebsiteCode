You would think there would be more than three... and you'd actually be right. I've done others, but some sites I just don't feel like showing off at the moment. The short story is landing here, at this site. This is different, simply because I did not just work on the front end of a project. I worked by myself on the entire thing. This site required a massive jump on skills with development, and I simply could not have done this site with the experience I had when making the others. This project was excellent when it came to growth as a web developer.

Goodness, I can't even begin to talk to you about the dozen-or-so fully coded layouts before I finally came to this one.
