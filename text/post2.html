Just last week, I visited the Playstation Vita meetup in New York where I got hands-on experience with the PS Vita. It was a great meet up where I got to socialize with people on video games and tech in general, something I <strike>rarely</strike> never do. I also got there early enough for a free T-shirt, which was nice for my ego considering my attempt to get there 3 hours early was not done in vain. In any case, I'm sure you want to hear about the console.<br />
<br />
First off, it is understood that the console is quite large for a portable. People are wondering why Sony would give such little incentive to carry this around in our pockets when we already carry, in terms of functionality,&nbsp;more capable smartphones. I want you to erase the thought of how big it is in your mind...<br />
<br />
...because it's <i>much bigger than you think it is</i>. As you can see, the screen alone trumps the entire length and width of the iPhone 4/4S. I know that the&nbsp;iPhone&nbsp;is fairly small in comparison to most smartphones, but the Vita just looks ridiculous. I had the utmost confidence that there was no way I'd be able to fit that in my pocket.<br />
<br />
Another quibble I had with the Vita concerned the analog sticks. Yes, I was delighted to see that the people in the design team listened to us when we said we wanted two sticks, but those two sticks are atrociously small. It doesn't take much for your fingers to end up slipping off the sticks, which are convex for some strange reason. That's probably another thing Sony needs to correct with their design. However, I really&nbsp;shouldn't&nbsp;be surprised. The designers of Playstation hardware don't seem to understand ergonomics very well (that or they don't let things like the human body get in the way of traditional design). The PS3 controller is too small for most people, and the PSPgo actually hurts your fingers after very little time. However, it would be completely ridiculous to not talk about the games they had there.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u><i>LittleBigPlanet</i></u></b><br />
This was the first game that I grabbed when I walked in. The graphics looked great, but all I was able to do was play a game of air hockey (as seen in the LittleBigPlanet 2 Sports Trailer) before the Vita froze and a sneakily walked away as if I didn't do it. That said, I was wondering what the developers were thinking when they made that mini-game.<br />
<br />
You control the movements on the ice by using the touchscreen, and it ended up being the perfect example of why gamers are resistant to touchscreen gaming. If I'm suppose to touch the screen to see the goalie, <i>how can I see the goalie when my finger is over him? </i>My finger blocks too much of my vision for me to control something so small.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u><i>Reality Fighters</i></u></b><br />
After that debacle, Reality Fighters was my next mission. This game seemed innocent enough to give my attention. I can't really speak on the fighting mechanics because I truthfully had no idea what I was doing. However, the Augmented Reality feature didn't work as well as I hoped. The fighters didn't respond to when I moved the Vita around. In fact, there was no regard to the angle that I was holding my Vita on. The game just assumed it was a flat surface, which sounds normal, except that the Vita was a<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEMDgvfFUcI">lways advertised as having 3D-like augmented reality features</a>. That's 0 for 2, Mr. Playstation Velvita Cheese.
<br />
<br />
<b><u><i>Sound Shapes</i></u></b><br />
This was the 3rd and last game I played before I left. It was also my most anticipated game that I heard of at the time coming for the Vita. Luckily, it was also the one game that didn't disappoint It played exactly how I thought it would, and that was great. However, it didn't compensate for the upset I experienced with the other games.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, I left&nbsp;disappointed&nbsp;in the Vita. My big fears of it's&nbsp;desperate&nbsp;need for a hardware redesign were confirmed, and the some of the big games didn't deliver in the way they promised.<br />
I already know why question you guys may be asking, "what about Uncharted?!" Yes, that game is probably the most hyped of all the games there, and the developers have certainly made the most out of what the Vita offers. However, I don't think Uncharted is a game that is good for a 5 inch screen. I would understand if Uncharted 3 was the game coming for the Vita, so there is the appeal of transferring saves from one home console to a mobile one. However, a game like Uncharted, one almost entirely dependent on&nbsp;set-pieces, really deserves no less than a 30+ inch screen and a big surround system to play it on, so I don't see this working as well as many fans would anticipate.<br />
<br />
Altogether, I was hoping the Vita would be amazing and win me over. Instead, I felt glad knowing that I had no immediate plans on purchasing it.</div>
