<a href="http://www.RedHookHub.com" style="text-decoration: none; color: #0000BB;">Red Hook Hub</a> was an organization I met during the Hack Red Rook Hackathon in Brooklyn. It is a service dedicated towards informing the residents of the neighborhood with nearby events, local alerts and more. I also worked a (admittedly small) bit on the front-end for this website, although this was the first time I've worked with a designer.
