The Ronald McDonald House website was a project I worked on during my senior year in college. Most of my work was done on the front end, working with interfaces. Admittedly, It was only part of a course and development continued on for quite some time after I finished the course. However, what I can say is that it gave me a huge understanding of how the development workplace is, and taught me the importance of communication. I consider this a stepping stone to where I am now.
