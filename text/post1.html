If I had to name my 3 favorite sports, it would go in this order:<br />
<br />
1) Basketball<br />
2) Football<br />
3) Skateboarding<br />
<br />
I honestly don't know many guys in my age group who haven't at least once tried skateboarding when their age was a single digit number and subsequently quit because they couldn't do an Ollie, literally the simplest trick in all of skateboarding. Perhaps the Tony Hawk video game series had something to do with it, as it has been around for almost 15 years. Then again, Activison released put out horrid sequels for most of those 15 years, and the abilities grew out of touch with who we are and what we wanted to be. Still, I think there was something about skateboarding video games that resonate with a lot of people. However, with every additional year, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVn_B8sDRes">billion point combos</a>&nbsp;became more plain and normal, and the generation of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RstrPAUmtnA">the 900</a> needed more. <br />
<br />
Which leads me down to this series. EA's <i>Skate</i> stomped the Tony Hawk series into an abysmal state. That should indicate how important the <i>Skate</i> series is, this game in particular. Yes, it has problems. It runs like crap on a Playstation 3. It doesn't have the create-a-park mode or the multiplayer proficiency like Skate 3 does, and I don't care. Where Skate 2 wins me over is in few, but big components.<br />

The city you Skate in is called San Vanelona - specifically New San Vanelona, after a huge natural disaster caused the place to get completely revamped from what was in the original <i>Skate</i>. This city takes the best of the real-life cities of San Francisco, Vancouver, and Barcelona (plus-points for a non-contrived portmanteau) and overall makes one of the most appealing game worlds I've ever gone through, at least when it comes to worlds this small. The attention to detail is superb, and it's aspirations for realism combined with its warm color scheme make it feel like home. Sure, a day-night cycle would have been cool, but that shining sun beaming down on the city makes everything more like an easy Sunday morning. Skating through the city (which is especially large) while listening to Weldon Irvine's "Morning Sunrise" or The Isley Brothers' "Footsteps in the Dark" is especially enthralling. There are a great number of enormous ramps, handrails, and long roads for you to perform tricks on, from the aesthetically pleasing to the downright ridiculous. Whatever kind of skateboarding you appeal to most, there are at least 3 or 4 skateparks for you.<br /><br />

The people look alive - as opposed to the cartoony feel of Skate 3 - and the wardrobe selection actually looks like a selection of clothes I'd actually wear, and while I understand that is completely subjective, that is rare to find in a video game for me. I actually love the design of this game, just about from head to toe.<br /><br />

Yes, these controls at first seem like they were created by a dog, platypus, or any other animal without thumbs. It seems crazy to think that almost every single trick you do can be pulled off with one analog stick. However, when you start linking tricks together, you realize it's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gbu4wSnsW3I">lot more intuitive than you thought it was</a>, especially in comparison to the Tony Hawk controls, which started out as crazy and got worse.<br /><br />

Don't get me wrong, these controls do take patience to master. That right analog stick is the heart and soul of this game, and there will be times when you don't completely understand why you did a 360 flip instead of a 360 hardflip, or why you did a nosegrind instead of a noseslide. However, when you get them down, you will be glad that you did, and almost everything in this game will change from an aggravating experience, to whatever experience you want it to be. Instead of judging a player's skill by the score he racks up at the end, you judge him on his style and creativity, the same way you judge real skateboarders. These controls are more than just a way of utilizing the player or interacting with what's around you. It's a subtle and effective educational system that help you understand the technical and stylistic aspects of skateboarding so much more.<br /><br />

When most gamers thinking of what games to play in order to relax, they probably think of the results of thatgamecompany's development <i>(fl0w, Flower, Journey)</i>. I, on the other hand, think of this. As a reference, this game came out in January of 2009, and yet I still play it to this day. There's nothing new for me to do. I have been in all of the areas and it was even the game I got my first platinum trophy with. What I come back to is that feeling of relaxing, doing whatever you want, and what I want to do is skateboard through this city and take my mind off of things. Not too long ago, a Youtube personality talked about <a href="http://youtu.be/5WHsJDXk7pM">Zen in Video Games</a>, and all the things mentioned in the video are what I feel about Skate 2.There has been no other game during the PS3/360 generation that gives me the simple pleasure of <i>taking it easy</i>, and thus, there has been no other game that I have attached myself to so strongly.<br /><br />

...And yet, EA had to tell Black Box to stop making <i>Skate</i> games so they could go back to making more terrible <i>Need for Speed</i> sequels again. Seriously?! Then the studio had to <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/04/24/ea-partners-facing-closure.aspx">close down</a> after the third one!? Sigh... modern day video game development issues.
